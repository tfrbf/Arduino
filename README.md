# Fire Fighter Robot
This is an arduino based robot.
It can detect Fire, CO gas and send defined alarms to controller.
It was our first experience to work with microcontroller and our gained experiences are very valuable.


## Hardware 
We used Arduino UNO as a microcontroller (Arduino CH can be used instead)


L298N runs 2 gearboxes if you want to upgrade it to use 4 gearboxes notice that each pair of gearboxes in one axis should act same. This driver needs 9v voltage to work so choose your battery carefully.
Remove speed pins cover to control the speed otherwise it runs in highest speed as default.
